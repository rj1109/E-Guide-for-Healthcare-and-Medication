        question:"What is Amblyopia",
        answer:"Amblyopia (also called lazy eye) is a type of poor vision that usually happens in just 1 eye but less commonly in both eyes. It develops when there’s a breakdown in how the brain and the eye work together, and the brain can’t recognize the sight from 1 eye. Over time, the brain relies more and more on the other, stronger eye — while vision in the weaker eye gets worse. Its called “lazy eye” because the stronger eye works better. But people with amblyopia are not lazy, and they cant control the way their eyes work."

        answer:"Many important skills are preserved for longer periods even while symptoms worsen. Preserved skills may include reading or listening to books, telling stories and reminiscing, singing, listening to music, dancing, drawing, or doing crafts.These skills may be preserved longer because they are controlled by parts of the brain affected later in the course of the disease."
